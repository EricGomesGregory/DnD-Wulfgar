## Leshy
Leshy are forest spirits that usually resemble that of an old man with long hair and beard made of moss, skin of bark, and glowing green eyes. They are powerful shapeshfters, capable of becoming the same size as the tallest tree in its forest and as small as a blade of grass.

Leshy are teritorial spirits that claim a forest as their domain, guarding it from humanoids and other forest spirits...
