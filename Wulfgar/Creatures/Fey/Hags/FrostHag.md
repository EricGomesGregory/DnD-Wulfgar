> ***Innate Spellcasting.***
> The Frost Hag hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
>
> At will: *frostbite, mage hand, message, ray of frost, vicious mockery*
>
> 3/day each: *cause fear, charm person, command, hex*
>
> 2/day each: *blur, ice knife, inflict wounds*
>
> 1/day each: *ice storm*
>
> ***Ice Walk.***
> The frost hag can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.
>
> ***Illusory Appearance.***
> The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical Illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and Humanoid shape. The Illusion ends if the hag takes a Bonus Action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this Effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the Illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
