> ***Innate Spellcasting.***
> The swamp hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
>
> At will: *druidcraft, infestation, poison spray, shillelagh*
>
> 3/day each: *detect poison and disease, ensnaring strike, entangle*
>
> 2/day each: *barkskin, web*
>
> 1/day each: *animate dead*
>
> ***Illusory Appearance.***
> The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical Illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and Humanoid shape. The Illusion ends if the hag takes a Bonus Action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this Effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the Illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
>
> ***Bog Walker.***
> The swamp hag can move across wetland surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of wetlands or bogs doesn't cost it extra moment.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The swamp hag makes two quarterstaff attacks.
>
> ***Quarterstaff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit* 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage.
