Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the iron maiden, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it.

Until the grapple ends, the target is Restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength Saving Throws, and the iron maiden can't use the same tendril on another target.
