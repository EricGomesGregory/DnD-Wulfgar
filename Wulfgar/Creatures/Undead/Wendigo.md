## Wendigo


<div class='descriptive'>

##### Wendigo Psychosis
A creature infected with wendigo psychosis starts experiencing symptoms after 2d4 days of containing it.

The first symptom is when the infected creature starts to crave meat, regardless if it's fresh or raw. If the infected tries to eat any other type of food, it will taste bitter and rancid, and the infected creature will have to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate what it has eaten. 

Each day, the infected creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, or their hunger for meat will become even stronger. If the infected creature fails 5 saving throws, they will start to crave the flesh of a humanoid, and must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw every day to resist the temptation.

Once the infected creature consumes the flesh of a humanoid, they will begin to transform into a wendigo over the course of 2d6 days. 

___
This curse can be removed with a *remove curse* spell, as long as the infected creature has not fully turned. Once the infected creature has fully turned into a wendigo, it becomes an undead and can only be cured with a *wish* spell.
