## Yuraj
Yuraj is a 6'8'' tall and slender man with greyish-blue skin covered in bandages. His head is warped in bandages with a piece of parchment (containing a spell written in a strange language) covering the center of its face.

And he wears a DESCRIBE_CLOTHING and wields a pair of old and ornate silvered katars.

### History
Yuraj once was a legendary warrior from the land of Nirwan that lived during the beginning of the 2nd era. While living he was the *chhaaya* (shadow) of a princess named **Rani Harish**.
___
While serving her he ended up traveling from Nirwan to the city-state of Carthus accompanying his master in a diplomatic mission.

While in Carthus the princess caught the attention of **Carthus, the 1st**.

One day while accompanying her on her nightly walk through the blue palace's garden they were ambushed by a group of strange knights that wounded Yuraj and captured Rani Harish.
___
After surviving the attack he regrouped with the members of the Nirwan court to inform them of the occurrence. 

After regrouping him and the court's *shadebinder* **Sial** tracked down the assailants to a catacomb beneath the palace where they fought their way to a mausoleum where they were only able to witness the princess being sacrificed in a dark ritual performed by Carthus himself.
___
With the princess gone and Yuraj mortally wounded Sial offered an accord to him; *Avenge his master in undeath*.

Yuraj woke up, a *Pishacha*, on a night of full moon in a boat being spirited away back to Nirwan.

___
Back in his homeland, he trained and hunted down monsters and creatures of the night. And for centuries he searched for Carthus's "scent".

After hundreds of years searching he finally returned to Carthus in order to finish his last command.
