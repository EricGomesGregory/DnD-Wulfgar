> ***Shapechanger.***
> If Carthus isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, Carthus can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, Carthus can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).***
> If Carthus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Misty Escape.***
> When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, Carthus transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.
>
> ***Regeneration.***
> Carthus regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Carthus takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Carthus's next turn.
>
> ***Spider Climb.***
> Carthus can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
>
> ***Children of the Night (1/Day).***
> Carthus magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats as a bonus action, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Carthus can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called Creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, Acting as allies of Carthus and obeying its spoken commands. The Beasts remain for 1 hour, until Carthus dies, or until Carthus dismisses them as a bonus Action.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** Carthus makes
>
> ***Bite (Bat or Vampire forms).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit* 7 (1d6 + 4) Piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and Carthus regains a number of hit points equal to that amount. The targets hit point maximum resturns to normal when it finishes a long rest.
>
> ***Charm.***
> Carthus targets one Humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see Carthus, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be Charmed by Carthus. The Charmed target regards Carthus as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Carthus's control, it takes Carthus's requests or Actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Carthus's bit Attack.
>
> Each time Carthus or Carthus's Companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, Ending the Effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the Effect lasts 24 hours or until Carthus is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus Action to end the Effect.
