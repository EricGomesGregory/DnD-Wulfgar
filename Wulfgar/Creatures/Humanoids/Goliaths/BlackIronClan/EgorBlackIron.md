#### Berserker Armor
*Armor (plate), legendary*

A set of black iron plate armor with highly articulated joints of dwarven craftsmanship.

This armor has two states Dormant and Active that are described bellow.

***Dormant.***
While dormant the armor is like a regular set of plate armor, but whenever you take damage or enter in combat you must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or activate the armor.

***Active.***
While the armor is active you gain the following features:
- Your AC is 20.
- Your Strength and Dexterity scores become 20, if they aren't higher.
- You gain proficiency with Strength and Dexterity saving throws if you didn't have them already.
- You are immune to being Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, Stunned, and Exhaustion, except for the 6th level.
- You are resistant to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
- At the end of each of your turns you suffer 1 level of Exhaustion.

The active state can switch to the Dormant state if you succeed on the Wisdom save that you can repeat at the end of your turn or if a spellcaster successfully casts *dispel magic*, the armor counts as being a 9th level spell.
