## Father Arthur
Father Arthur is a 5'5'' tall 60 year old man with tanned skin, long grayish-brown hair, blue eyes and a small nose. He wears a simple beige tunic with a red scarf around its neck and a strangely ornate ring on his left hand.

His clothes are ragged from the waste down, showing that he has traveled for a long time on foot. 


### History
Arthur once was cardinal in the city of High Rock, he watched as the previous royal lineage fell from grace and fled to his city in the mountains. At first he took the former royal family into his city, giving them a plot of land where they could live in peace and quiet.
___
Arthur in his own time took up studding the arcane arts and discovered latent magical abilities, that he attributed to God's blessing, that allowed him to aid the sick and weak of his city. So in the dead of night he would dress in common clothes and would perform small miracles on the poorest of the region.

Emboldened by this power, Arthur increased his sermons and incited a greater fervor in his priests, in the hopes that as his faith had granted him powers the same would happen to his followers.
___
With this increased fervor in the priests of the city, the former royal family saw a way to regain control and began to influence the priests into granting the family more power and influence.

As the years went by and father Arthur saw no rise to powerful priests that would aid the sick, so he drifted from his quest and returned to just aiding the week and needy.
___
Until one day when the priests, influenced by the former royal family, began a witch hunt killing political adversaries and less favored members of astoran society. Seeing the horrors of the hunt, that he had accidentally aided to create, Arthur abandoned his position and left the city in search for atonement to his sin by aiding those outside of his city.
