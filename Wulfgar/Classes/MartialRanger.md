That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

#### Bestial Fury

For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have 8 mana. With a Wisdom of 16. If you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it at 1st-level or 2nd-level. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
___
