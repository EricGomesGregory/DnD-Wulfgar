#### Mindbreaker
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to speak a sphinx's riddle. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can hear you and understands at least one language, it must make an Intelligence saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. 

On a failure, it is incapacitated and can't move until the end of your next turn. While incapacitated, the creature is able to perceive only itself and you. 

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect if you are within 30 feet of the creature, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on a success.
