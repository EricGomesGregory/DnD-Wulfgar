## Martial Archetypes


### Banneret
A banneret is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of one in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.

A banneret lead through deeds and words. As a banneret spearheads an attack, their actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.


#### Rallying Cry
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.

When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.


#### Envoy
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.

At 7th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from this feature.


#### Inspiring Surge
Starting at 7th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 30 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack as part of your action, provided that it can see or hear you.

Starting at 18th level, you can choose two allies within 30 feet of you, rather than one.


#### Lead the Charge
At 10th level, you gain a bonus to your initiative equal to your Charisma modifier.


#### Bulwark
Starting at 15th level, whenever you use your Indomitable feature to re-roll a saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can immediately choose one allied creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you that failed the same effect. Both you and that creature re-roll the saving throw and must use the new rolls.
