## Ranger Conclaves



## Martial Ranger Conclaves
Across the wilds, rangers come together to form loose conclaves associations whose members share a similar outlook on how best to protectnature from those who would despoil it.


### Beast Master
Some rangers form a strong bond with a beast...

#### Beast Companion
Starting at 3rd level, you form a bond with a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and fights alongside you. Choose its stat block-Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block.

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

#### Bestial Fury
Starting at 7th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.

### Hunter
Some rangers seek to master weapons to better protect civilization from the terrors of the wilderness. Members of the Hunter Conclave learn specialized fighting techniques for use against the most dire threats, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.


#### Hunter's Style
Starting at 3rd level, you gain one of the following feature of your choice:

***Bounty Hunter.***
When you hit a humanoid with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier, if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

***Giant Killer.***
When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

***Horde Breaker.***
Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 10 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.


#### Hunter's Agility
Starting at 7th level, you gain one of the following feature of your choice.

***Evasion.***
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area Effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

***Uncanny Dodge.***
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an Attack, you can use your Reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.


#### Hunter's Boon
At 14th level, you gain one of the following feature of your choice. 

***Tunnel Vision.***
You can use a bonus action to gain advantage on all weapon attacks made against a marked creature, but you have disadvantage on attacks made against any other creature during that round.

***Archer's Tempo.***
Whenever you hit a marked creature with a critical hit from a ranged weapon you can use a bonus action to make one additional weapon attack.



#### Master of the Hunt
At 18th level, you have mastered the art of tracking down and slaying your prey. You can use your marked as prey feature on a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

### Druidic Guardian
Some rangers take a druidic vow and dedicated themselves to the protection of forests, rivers, plains, mountains, and many other locations with strong connection to nature's spirit.


#### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with druidic powers, giving you the ability to cast spells.

##### Cantrips
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

#### Mana
The Druidic Guardian table shows how much mana you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of mana equal to the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended mana when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have 8 mana. With a Wisdom of 16. If you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it at 1st-level or 2nd-level. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you are able to cast, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
___
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
___
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Wild Presence
At 18th level, while surrounded by wilderness you can call upon its spirits to conjure either awe inspiring imagery of nature or frightening visages of nature's wrath. For 1 minute or until you lose your Concentration (as if you were casting a Concentration spell), each Hostile creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be Charmed (if you chose awe) or Frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

### Night Stalker
Some rangers train to wield the night as a weapon, hunting their prey in the darkness. Rangers of this conclave develop specialized techniques to hunt and fight both in darkness and against creatures that rely on darkvision. 

#### Ambusher
At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 30 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. When you take the Attack action on that turn, you have advantage on your first attack roll and the attack deals additional damage equal to your prey die.


#### Umbral Sight
At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are hidden to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.


#### Stalker's Boon
At 7th level, you gain one of the following feature of your choice:

***Iron Mind.***
You have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You double your proficiency bonus with your Wisdom saving throws.

***Evasion.***
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area Effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.


#### Stalker's Flurry
At 14th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.


#### Shadowy Dodge
Starting at 18th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.
