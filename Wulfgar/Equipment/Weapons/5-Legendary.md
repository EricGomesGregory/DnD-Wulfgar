## Legendary
The following are legendary weapons of the wolrd of Wulfgar...


#### Moonlight Greatsword
*Weapon (greatsword), legendary* (Attunement)

***Attunement.***
To attune to this weapon you must have at least 13 Intelligence and spend 1 hour under moonlight. Otherwise it performs like a common greatsword.

***Magic Weapon.***
This weapon deals magical slashing damage.

***Moonlight Strikes.***
This weapon has a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You can spend a charge with an action to perform one of the following attacks:

- *Moonlight Arc.* You swing the blade creating a arc of moonlight that travels in a cone. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.
- *Moonlight Thrust.* You thrust the blade creating a line of moonlight in that direction. Each creature in a 5-foot-wide 15-foot-long line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

The DC for these attacks is equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. You recover all spent charges at the end of a long rest.
