## Carthus Quests
The following are quests for the party at level 3...

### Old Wounds
A crew of elven slavers have been kidnapping children from the slums of Carthus to sell them in the Elyrian slave market. The crew are comprised of vassel warriors of the ELYRIAN_FAMILIY_NAME that attacked Hild's familiy estate when she was younger.

The party can enter in contact with the case when a mother comes to the player's home in search of help. She learned of their heroic deeds in the church, where they venquished a demon. The mother (Sitra) is searching for her son **Haka** but she knows of 6 more guardians that have lost their children. If the players decide to help she can lead them to the church where the others are congregating.
