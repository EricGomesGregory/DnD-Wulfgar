### Calling in the Night
During one of the cold nights a silver fox comes to the party attempting to call them deeper into the forest. If the party follows it into a cave a druid will inform the party that a weapon has chosen a party member as its wielder. The party then must venture into the a cave near the sea where the weapon has been slumbering.

#### Call of the night
At dusk a small silver fox with red eyes approaches the cabin where the party is sleeping. It then strikes a playful pose and immediately switches to a almost human like bipedal pose and with its snout the fox points to the forest.
