### Forres
After the long journey the fleet reaches the port city of Forres, DECRIPTION. Within the city the characters can visit the following locations and partake in the following events.


#### Druidic Ritual
Word spreads that a druid has organized a ritual for next dawn dedicated to the god of life and nature Aaine, the summer stag.

If the party decides to join the ritual they will reach a small clearing in the forest where a group of people covered in long tunics surround a massive bonfire, atop a stone platform a druid speaks in elvish "We offer thee Aaine our bodies and devotion may you bring us a bountiful spring, a warm and a wondrous summer" as he hurls a burning branch into the bonfire igniting it.

Immediately after the flames rise the robed men and woman remove their robes to reveal that they are nude and they begin a dance around the fire. If the players join the dance they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or start to hallucinate...
