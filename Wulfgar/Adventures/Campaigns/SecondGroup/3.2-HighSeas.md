### Wyverns of Doom Pirates
Three ships dawning green sails depicting a forward facing red wyvern. This ships are not attempting to kill the party but they are seeking to capture them for unknown reasons.


#### Ships Approach
Three longships appear on the horizon, on their banners a red dragon over a green field. With a successful DC 13 Intelligence (History) check a character can determine that they are pirates from Vinheim. They signal that they wish to talk not fight, with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check a character can discern that they are lining.

If the party decides to hail their signal and talk follow to parley, if they keep their pace follow to Chase.


#### Chase
If the party decides to ignore the pirate fleet they must then escape their pursuers in a skill challenge. Each party member must make a DC 15 skill check for three rounds, if the party accumulates three failures they fail and the enemy ships reach them.

At the end of each round during the skill challenge each character must make a DC 9 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (3d8 + 9) Piercing damage or half as much on a successful one. If the party has accumulated at least 1 failure the DC increases to 13.

If the party accumulates three failures the ships surround the party's and they start a **Parley**, else they escape the pirates range.


#### Parley
If the party decides to parley with the pirates or they failed their escape attempt, the pirates approach the player's ship. From the largest ship a man (Grimkel) presents himself the captain of the Wyverns of Doom.

***History.***
Grimkell was part of the attack that caused Hild's family downfall, during the attack his role was to ensure that no one escaped but due to his personal code he let Hild row her boat and escape during that knight.

After the events of that night he prospered until he was betrayed by the family he aided during that night. He and his crew were hunted and went from a fleet of seven ships to the three that surround the party now.
