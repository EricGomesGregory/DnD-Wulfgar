## Carthus Quest


### X Marks the Spot
In Carthus the party decides to seek the treasure buried in the desert. To do so they must first investigate the map to determine where the X is, plot a course to their destination, and finally dig up the treasure.

#### Investigating the Map
A character that is proficient in **cartographer's tools** can make a Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine where the X is.

- *8.* The party discovers that the X is a day from Carthus.
- *10.* The party discovers that the X is in a unpopulated area.
- *15.* The party discovers that the X is in a small hill in the middle of the desert.
- *20.* The party discovers that the X is used by the slaver guild as a body dumping area.

#### Reaching the X
If the party has determined where X is located, they must make a Wisdom (Survival) check. If the party haven't determined the path the Wisdom (Survival) check is made with disadvantage.
