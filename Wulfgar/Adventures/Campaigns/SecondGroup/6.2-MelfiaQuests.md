You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragonâ€™s fiery breath or a fireball spell.

> ***Antimagic Cone.*** The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholderâ€™s own eye rays.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit* 0 (2d8) Piercing damage. 
>
> ***Eye Rays.*** The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:
>
> *1) Charm Ray.* The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.
>
> *2) Paralyzing Ray.* The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> *3) Fear Ray.* The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ```
> ```
>
> *4) Slowing Ray.* The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the targetâ€™s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature canâ€™t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> *5) Enervation Ray.* The targeted creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> *6) Telekinetic Ray.* If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the rayâ€™s telekinetic grip until the start of the beholderâ€™s next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isnâ€™t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.
>
> *7) Sleep Ray.* The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.
>
> *8) Petrification Ray.* The targeted creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
>
> *9) Disintegration Ray.* If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.
>
> *0) Death Ray.* The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 44 (8d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.
