## Journey to Canibri
After escaping Caaraid the party has stopped in the ruins of an old castle, there they will meet Rishu the drunk...


### Stop at Ruins
After escaping the town of Caaraid, the party has stopped at the ruins of an old castle at the shores of Loch Sgaathan. Investigating the ruins the party will find a man that reeks of alcohol sleeping in a stone block.

If the party awakens the men he will attempt to flee by scaling the walls but will quickly tire. Alternatively if the party waits for him to awaken naturally he will attempt to strike a conversation.

***Rishu.***
is a short man with light brown skin, narrow brown eyes, a shaved head and a long and narrow nose. He wears a strange plain green tunic with baggy beige pants that are wrapped at the shins. He carries a small leather bag, a quarterstaff, and a strange bottle of alcohol.

Rishu is a prince of the kingdom of Dulaan and a pen pal of an elvish sorcerer known as Sulyvhan of Irithyll. He has journeyed to the Boreal Forest in search of meeting his friend.

#### Map in a Bottle
As the party continues their voyage a glass bottle floats towards them, up to three characters can attempt to catch the bottle with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check a character falls in the water.

If a character successfully catches the bottle they will discover that a piece of paper is contained within. Inspecting the paper the party can realize that it is a map adorned with strange symbols. A character that knowns the Thieve's Cant language can discern that the symbols indicates a buried treasure in a island in the loch.

With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check a character can conclude that the island is near Canibri. Reaching the island the party can find a small rocky landmass, investigating the area the party can find a a mound of dirt.

Digging the mound they can find a chest with a white and red rose insignia, the chest has 500 gp, a silver dagger, and 20 silver tipped arrows within it.


### City of Canibri
The small city of Canibri is surrounded by stone walls with large cylindrical towers that have blue tile roofs. Within the walls, the city is a maze of cobblestone streets that reek of piss and shit, walled cemetaries, and tall gothic buildings.

#### Locations
The city has the following notable locations.


***Padarsan Keep.***
Located in the left section of the city, from the river's flow, the Padarsan Keep is a small but tall stone castle with white walls adorned with blue roses painted on them. The keep resides inside of a walled garden that is constantly guarded by knights in fluted armor. 


***Seora's Home.***
A small apartment above a tea shop, Grimkel refers to this location as his brother's home. It is the house of a reclusive writer known as Seora that is a blood brother to Grimkel.

Seora is a tall but hunched men with few long strands of white hair remaining in his head, sunken blue eyes, and a small nose. He wears a plain long dark grey robe.  

The house is located in a densely populated section of the city in the left side, near the river Moire with a tavern across the street and a cemetary 120 feet from the house. 


***Hen's Head Tavern.***
The Hen's Head is a large tavern, located across the street from Seora's home. Within it the party can find various small tables with people, a bar where they can buy drinks and food, and larger tables where people play games of chance. Asking for a good time to the bartender will lead the character to the second floor where whores await customers at the door of the rooms.

***Fat Fishermen's Inn.***
The Fat Fishermen is an old abandoned building in the bad side of town...

## Shady Job

If the party decides to open the box they will discover that it contains dried up herbs. With a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Medicine) check a character can discern that the herbs have relaxing properties.

The party then must escape the scene with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.


#### Back to Base
After returning to Seora he informs them that the *fat fishermen* is an old abandoned inn in the bad side of town. He urges them to retrieve the package as he could be in trouble if anyone finds out, if pressured Seora will offer 300 gp as a reward.

If the party follows the plan Jabedhaia will follow the party despite their protest, during which time all Wisdom (Survival) checks are made with advantage as he points out unseen pathways.
