# Painted World of Naryn
___
The painted world of Naryn is a demiplane created by Ardghal Elyrsen in order to keep its beloved Naryn safe from the witch hunt of the end of the second era. The world resembles a snow covered mountainous land surrounded by a dark boreal forest and beyond it a endless fog that stretches to the horizon.

The world is scarcely populated by simulacrums of humanoids, mostly elves, and other creatures be them common or fantastical. The only exception are Naryn herself and a handful of creatures that have entered this world either by entering the painting or by entering it through the astral plane.

___
***Ardghal Elyrsen.*** was one of the last sons of Elyrion and Silvaris and he lived from the end of dragons to the fall of the elven empire at the end of the second era, he was a tall and muscular elven man like his father with long black hair and milk white skin like his mother but despite his strength he developed a passion for the softer arts and eventually becoming the greatest painter of the elven world.

When he was a young man he met a feral woman named Naryn, the forbidden daughter of Innur the traitor dragon, that infatuated both demigods and eventually developed into a secret relationship. At the same time the elves were beginning to discover the deception of Innur and began a witch hunt against all of the descendants of Innur, fearing that his beloved would be caught by the hunt Ardghal painted a world of fantasy for her and embedded a mirrored door locked with a twin silver key.

He gifted his painting to one of his brothers, the king of Irithyll, and left the empire with an entourage to the other side of the plains where he would open a mirror with the other twin silver key to his beloved world's. As he was traversing the plains he was caught by the conquest of the Adernian empire and succumbed to the wounds of battle before reaching his destination.

His entourage, for respect of their lord demigod, carried their master's wishes to the land beyond the plains where they founded a nation.
