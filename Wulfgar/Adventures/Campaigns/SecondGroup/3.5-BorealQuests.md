# Boreal Quests


## Escort
The party and their fleet are tasked with escorting three merchant ships up the Dubhan river util they reach Caaraid, a wealthy town that controls the flow of trade between Elyria and Silvaria.

During the voyage the party will be attacked by a pirate crew of three ships one day, then cross with another merchant fleet with news of Caaraid causing the party to have to cross the forest in order to reach loch Sgaathan.

### Pirate's Attack
As the parties fleet approaches a narrowing in the river, flanked by two massive trees that bend towards the water, two longships come from upstream as another longship quickly approaches from downstream. The approaching ships have orange sails with a blue capricorn painted on it.

As the ships get closer and closer a volley of arrows are launched towards the fleet, each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw taking 27 (3d8) Piercing damage or half as much on a successful one. **Roll Initiative!**

After one round of combat a group of 8 corsairs jump from the trees into the merchant ships at the center of the fleet.

### News from the Loch
As the party fleet continues their journey they cross with a fleet of five merchant ships that are returning from Caaraid. If the party decides to trade information with the other fleet the party can discover the following information:

- The town has increased its parols in the river and the town has increased its taxes.

- The town of Caaraid that used to be a neutral party in the trade between Elyria and Silvaria has positioned more in favor of Silvaria after the lord's son was married to the daughter of Oolacile's lord.


### Night Stop
During one of the evenings, the fleet will spot a village on a manmade bay 1 mile ahead. The fleet may stop for the night on this small village.

### Nameless village
The village is a small collection of wooden houses with grass roofs and one longhouse that seems to be a tavern.

The village is mostly populated of young couples, children, and the occasional elder.
___
***Frightening Tales.***
Within the tavern, seated in a bear fur, a circle of children hear stories from an elderly men. If the party decides to listen in on the tale they will hear the story of the Goblin Hoard.

The goblin hoard is a legend that states that a hoard of small green humanoids with large shaved heads large cat-like eyes and a mouth with saw-like teeth. This hoard runs at night trough the forest carrying large hemp sacks.

When the hoard reaches a village they search for houses with open windows and snatch the children and turn them into new goblins for the hoard.

When the story ends the window near the elder shakes violently, sending the children screaming into their mother's legs, then a drunken laughter emits from the window.


```
```

### Crossroads
After completing their contract with the merchants the party fleet finds itself with two options, either risk their luck and pass through the town, or move the ships through the forest in a feet of madness.

#### Risk and Luck
If the party decides to test their luck, roll on the Luck Table to determine the state of the city.

##### Luck Table
| 1d3 | DC | State of the City                   |
|:---:|:--:|:------------------------------------|
|  1  | 17 | The city is in high alert           |
|  2  | 15 | The city is well guarded            |
|  3  | 13 | The city is chaotic with few guards |

As the fleet moves through the central canal they enter a Skill Challenge of two in which the party must accumulate 3 successes without accumulating 3 failures. During each round each member of the party, including named NPCs, must make a different DC skill check.

If the party accumulates 3 failures each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) Piercing damage or half as much on a successful one. The fleet are able to pass and reach Loch Sgaathan.


#### Feet of Madness
If the party decides to move the ships through the forest then the group enters a Skill Challenge of three rounds in which the party must accumulate 6 successes without accumulating 3 failures. During each round each member of the party, including named NPCs, must make a different DC 15 skill check, on a fail the character in question can suffer 1 point of exhaustion to succeed instead.

If the party accumulates 3 failures one ship abandons Grimkel's crew out of frustration, taking 800 gp with them. The remaining ships and crew are able to pass and reach Loch Sgaathan.
