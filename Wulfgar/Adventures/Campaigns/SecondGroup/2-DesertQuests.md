## Quests in Shidai


### Stealing it Back
The inquisition of the Holy Path has arrested a noble on the charges of being a cultist of a dark god and a mage and his collection of artifacts are being held in a shipyard on the banks of the Nhar river.
___
As the day begins, a massive crowd congregates around the TEMPLE_NAME cathedral to witness the execution of a noble on the charges of occultism and witchcraft. The noble in question was a friend of SALADIN_FAMILITY_NAME family.

Jabedhaia informs the party that some of the nobles artifacts, acquired by Saladin's parents, are being held in a shipyard on the banks of the Nhar river and those items will be destroyed and dumped in the river in a ceremony by the Holy Path.

He then informs the party that they should steal back some of the artifacts and re sell them in the black market so they can fund future expeditions.


#### The Moonlit Shipyard



Among the artifacts in the shipyard the party can find the following notable items.
___
***Red Alchemist's Book.***
A large tome with a cover made of red linen. In the interior of the book is composed of strange drawings depicting the same seven characters: a queen with red hair, a king with golden hair, two bishops dressed in blue, and three woman dressed in green and caring tree branches; performing mondaine acts such as entering or exiting a castle.

With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check of proficiency with Alchemist's supplies a character can discern that the book is encoded with the recipe for **Healing Potions**.
