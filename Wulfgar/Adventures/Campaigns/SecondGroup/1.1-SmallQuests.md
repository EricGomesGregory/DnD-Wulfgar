### Slaver's Request
Captain Alexis has been given a request from a merchant that has lost one of its livestock during an accident and it has been sealing food from the nearby farms. The merchant is offering 60 gp for a person or group that is capable of returning its property alive.

Alexis gives the party the direction to the merchant's camp.


#### Slavers Camp
The camp resides in a shallow valley between two hills and is composed of four large tents, six carts and a large brazier in the center. As the player characters enter the camp they are quickly approached by Laslo and a adernian guard.

***Laslo.***
Laslo is a 41 year old man that is 5'5'' tall, with ebony skin, appraising dark brown eyes, a long and well kept black beard, and a large nose. He wears a white tunic with a grey scarf around his shoulders, a yellow turban, and three ornate rings on each hand.

Laslo is the slave master of the camp and is a very persuasive and intelligent man. He will inform the party of their goal to capture a "young 6'00'' tall woman with short blond hair, blue eyes and a toned but slender body".

In addition he informs the player characters that he has heard rumors that she has been stealing from nearby farms, but his guards were unable to capture her.


#### The Hunt
After the party leaves the camp they can start to search for the woman. The Hunt is composed of the following phases:

***Tracking.***
The tracking phase is a skill challenge in which each party member can perform a DC 13 skill check or aid another character in their check. If the party accumulates three successes the party moves to the *Chase* phase, if they fail to accumulate the necessary successes the party moves to the *Ambush* phase.

***Chase.***
The party find their target wondering in a field with tall grass between two farms, if the party approaches without being stealthy she will start to sprint. This starts a chase in which each player character involved must make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to catch up to her. A character that has failed the check can push themselves to their limit to succeed with 1 point of exhaustion.

This leads to the **Confrontation**.

***Ambush.***
Kylea ambushes a party member, attempting a grapple on it, if she succeeds she will put her axe to the throat of the character she has grappled and will begin to shout in elvish.

This leads to the **Confrontation**.
