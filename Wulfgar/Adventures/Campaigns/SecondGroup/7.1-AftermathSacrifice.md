# Aftermath of a Sacrifice
___
As the party climbs the lonely mountain towards the Stellar Keep, the ground begins to shake and the clouds in the sky quickly swirl and dissipates.


After a short while, the sky clears and the ground stabilizes, to reveal that the painted word has been transported to the plains between Hafexia, Vrostia, and Forossa.

The party then has a choice, either continue climbing the mountain, leading to the **Sorceress Gambit**, or abandon the climb leading to the **Lost out of Time**.

## Sorceress Gambit
The party resume their climb, advancing further and further up the mountain
