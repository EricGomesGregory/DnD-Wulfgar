## Plot Quests



### Spy Within the Walls
The Band of the Wolves have sent a spy into the city of Birchtown to sequester the daughter of lord flannegan, Melenia. In addition he is tasked with attempting to murder Gwyn during the festival of the new year.

Gwyn calls the group and informs them that lord Flannegan and the Band of the Wolves probably will attempt to sequester the lord's daughter or will attempt an assassination against him. So he enlists the group to investigate the people that have arrived in the city for the festival.


#### The Willing Hostage
Valerian Coppereye invites During and Alaor to his estate so they can aid him with a visitor. He is holding Flannegan's daughter as a guest and "hostage" and is worried about her ring hand, as well as her occasional coughing. 


***Melena Fall. or Melenia Flannegan.***
Melena Fall is a 5'4'' tall, 20 year old woman with deep green eyes, pale skin, crimson hair, and a square face. She wares a simple indigo dress under a beige wool jacket. On her right ring finger she wares a ring made of petrified wood, the finger has a small wood-like growth surrounding it. She puts on a distinctive perfume whenever she is summoned.

In a conversation with Melena she informs the characters that she has a sickness known as *Swamp Rot*, a degenerative sickness that has afflicted her from a young age and should have lead to her death. But her father sought the aid of a witch known as Zullie to cure Melena's disease and was gifted with the **Petrified Wood Ring** to protect her from the effects of *Swamp Rot*.

Recently she doffed the ring to see if her sickness was cured but quickly became sick so she wore the ring once more and a wood-like growth appeared on her ring finger.

In addition Melena also informs the characters that she was not taken hostage by Gwyn.
