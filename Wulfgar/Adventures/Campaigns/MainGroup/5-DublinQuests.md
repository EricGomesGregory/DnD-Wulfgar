# Dublin Quests
___
The following are the quest available in Dublin and its surrounding area.


## Cat-Like Thief
On the main square of Dublin a man is shouting news regarding the city. Among the random news one catches the attention of the party: "The merchant's guild as well as the brewer's guild and the banker's guild offer a bounty of 300 gp to whom can capture alive the midnight thief!"

If the party talks to the herald he will direct them to the Bank of the Five Fingers, where they will be informed.



## Game of Cat and Mouse
This is a parallel adventure to Cat-Like Thief dedicated to the character of Evor. In which a childhood friend of Evor, Regan, has sighted him in the city and attempts to contact him using thieve's cant. She then starts a chain of clues that eventually will lead him to her hiding place.

#### Regan
Regan is a averagely tall woman with short reddish-brown hair, simple traveler's clothes, a dark green cloak, and a leather belt with various pouches. She is a very boyish woman with a quiet but brash personalty...

When she was a child she used to be very boyish girl that would play with the boys of her village, especially with Evor despite his mother's strange clinginess. When she was about ten years old her and her family abandoned their village in the middle of the night to escape their debt to the local noble.

They headed to Dublin in hopes of becoming weavers but they were attacked by bandits that killed her mother and father. Alone in dublin she was taken to a house of Namire (orphanage), where she learned to fight, sneak, and steal with the other children. When she was 13 she escaped the orphanage and became a street thief.

One year ago she stole a silver ring from a hafexian traveler in a tavern. After wearing it for a couple of months she discoverd that the ring gave her "cat's luck" when she fell from a tower that would have killed her. Ever since she has been stealing from higher towers and noblemen's keeps.

She has two charges remaining but she is unaware of the number of charges she has.



### First Contact
As the party is walking on the streets of Dublin Evor hears a strange whistling that reminds him of home, as he searches for the origin of the whistling he catches the green eyes of a woman with short red hair that leaves him uncomfortable, she disappears into a crowd. Any attempt to find her will fail but if he searches for her will grant him the first clue, a joker card with "after dusk" written on it.

The clue indicates him to go to the Twisted Jester tavern after dusk.
