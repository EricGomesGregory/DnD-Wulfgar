They headed to Dublin in hopes of becoming weavers but they were attacked by bandits that killed her mother and father. Alone in dublin she was taken to a house of Namire (orphanage), where she learned to fight, sneak, and steal with the other children. When she was 13 she escaped the orphanage and became a street thief.

One year ago she stole a silver ring from a hafexian traveler in a tavern. After wearing it for a couple of months she discoverd that the ring gave her "cat's luck" when she fell from a tower that would have killed her. Ever since she has been stealing from higher towers and noblemen's keeps.
