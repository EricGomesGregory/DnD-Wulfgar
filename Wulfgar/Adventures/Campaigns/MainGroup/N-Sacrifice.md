## Sacrifice
When Alaor inevitably uses the **Egg of Rebirth**, the party...


The sky darkens as the moon covers the sun in an eclipse, the sky becomes a strange black, and the ground shakes as the party and any other creature within a 1 mile radius is transported into one of the deepest layer of the Astral World.

When the party regains their senses, they find themselves in a stone brick structure made of impossible staircases, platforms that bend in unnatural ways, and at the center a large dark blue sphere that pulses with a faint blue light. The location that the party finds themselves in seems to be floating in darkness with only the eclipsed sun in the sky.

As if piercing the darkness a group 5 (2d4) of manta ray looking creatures fly towards the creatures within the structure, roll **Initiative!**
