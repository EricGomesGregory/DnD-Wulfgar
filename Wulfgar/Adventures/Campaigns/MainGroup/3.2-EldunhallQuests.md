### Cave of Darkness
After discussing with the elders of Eldunhall, the party is challenged to investigate a cave that has been isolated after two groups of miners disappeared. In reality the collective fears of the creatures that may lurk within the deeper caves has coalesced a small section of the shallowest layer of the Astral world, bringing creatures such as Kobolds.

The miners delved into the cave, reached the lowest layer of the Astral world and were attacked by the Kobolds, killing them and offering their bodies to their king.
