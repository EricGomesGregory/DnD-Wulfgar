### Cave of Darkness
After discussing with the elders of Eldunhall, the party is challenged to investigate a cave that has been isolated after two groups of miners disappeared. In reality the collective fears of the creatures that may lurk within the deeper caves has coalesced a small section of the shallowest layer of the Astral world, bringing creatures such as Kobolds.

The miners delved into the cave, reached the lowest layer of the Astral world and were attacked by the Kobolds, killing them and offering their bodies to their king.

***Kobold.***
The kobold is a small humanoid with the head of a dragon, a grayish blue skin composed of lizard-like scales, sunken eyes that glow yellow, metallic blue fangs and claws that allows it to climb the rocks of the deep caves, and a breath that spews poisonous grey cloud.
