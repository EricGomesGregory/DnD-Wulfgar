The wolf member (Reinhard) has been granted by the Lord Flannagan of Wexford


### Stone Face Sin
The crew of dwarves known as the Stone Faced, that previously had attacked a keep from Wexford, are continuing their brutal and nihilistic campaign through the Kings Plains. Currently they have grown their group and have started to raid villages in the borderlands of Wexford.


#### Introduction
As the party is continuing their journey to Birchtown they spot a column of smoke that seems to be originating from behind a hill 5 miles away, with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) or Cartographer's tools check the party can determine that the smoke is coming from a village in the borderlands between Wexford and Birchtown.

As the party approaches the village they can spot corpses tied to 3 feet poles in very uncomfortable positions, with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check the party can determine that the men died in the last two days from battle wounds.


#### The Village
The ravaged village has five smoldering buildings that originate the smoke and only three buildings that remain, the church that seems to have been sacked, a small house, and the tavern.

***Church.***
Within the church the party can find the dead bodies of the priest and two acolytes on the ground, on the wall behind the lectern has a black skull with white teeth (symbol of Hurkek) painted on the wall, on the lectern a bloodied banner envelops a dead lamb. The banner is dark grey with a light grey face on it.

***Tavern.***
When the party enters the tavern their nostrils are attacked by a discomforting smell. The tavern is full of broken tables, discarded mugs, bottles of ale and wine, and animal bones. A single long table remains intact with a dwarvish text carved into it "Kjellbru was here". Within a room of the tavern three tied and gagged women in rags cry together, unspeakable horrors have happened in this room.

***Small House.***
Within the small house the party can find a pile of dwarf corpses with a text in dwarvish carved in the walls "A fate fitting the fools that pretend to be men".

___
After exiting the village the party can spot a small column of white smoke coming from a grove 8 miles away, with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) or Cartographer's tools check the party can determine that the smoke is coming from an encampment within the grove.


#### Stone Face Encampment
If the party decides to approach the camp they can approach openly or attempt to sneak close to it, to do so the party must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) check.

If the party approaches openly they will be confronted by a crossbowmen (Falki) and must convince him to let them in to the camp. The same event will happen to all the characters that have failed their Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Within the cave that the bandits were hiding, the party can find two dead horses that have a broken leg each and their bellies have been cut open, with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check the party can discover that the horses had their legs broken due to impact prior to being killed.

Deeper in the cave the party can find a improvised shelter made with a cart, within it they can find a chest with a strange lock.


#### Strange Chest
The chest is a small ornate metal box, adorned with two red cockatrices on either side of the lock. The lock it self has no keyhole, instead it has a circular metal plate with an arcane glyph in its center, with a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check the party can discover that the lock requires magic to be opened and that it contains a curse within it.

A character can attempt a spell roll to open the lock (open DC 15), on a 1 on the d20 the lock curses the creature attempting to open it with Blindness. The creature affected by the curse can remove it with a *remove curse* spell.

Upon opening the chest the party can find a small white egg shaped stone with various dark blue cracks. The item is the **egg of rebirth** also known as the egg of wants, stone of desire, and SYNONIMUS_NAME.


#### Egg of Rebirth
*Wondrous item, legendary*

The Egg of Rebirth is a egg-shaped stone, with various crack filled by a dark blue material. When exposed to moonlight it reacts with a faint blue glow.

***Inscrutable magic.***
This item's magic seems to originate from the deepest layer of the Astral World. Its effects can't be identified through magical means.


***Astral Rebirth.***
While in possession of this item a you can initiate a ritual, by uttering the phrase "I sacrifice", that involves sacrificing the lives of other humanoids, the number determining the strength of the ritual.

During this ritual the smallest range that encompasses the sacrifices is transported to the deepest layer of the Astral World, where monsters will attempt to devour them. During this time you are transformed into an astral creature, granting you powers but sacrificing your humanity in the process.
