### Village of Exter
Exter is a small walled village composed of small houses, a tavern, a blacksmith and a great hall that surround a fighting pit on the central plaza.

The village was founded by the great grandfather of Hector Marshall in order to create the fighting pit without being taxed by the astoran or forossan kingdoms.

***Oscar Downie.*** is a young man in his early thirties with short dark-brown hair, brownish-green eyes and a unkept goatee. He wears simple worker clothes under an old large and thick leather apron that clearly belonged to his father.

He recently inherited the blacksmith after his father died one night after a mysterious heart attack one year ago.

The great hall is a larger wooden square building with a double door adorned with carvings of farmers, masons and blacksmiths. Within it the party can find the following characters:
