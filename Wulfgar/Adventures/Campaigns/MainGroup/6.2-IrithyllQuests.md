# Irithyll Quests
___
After reaching the south west gate of Irithyll the party has split in two groups, one that has infiltrated the city by presenting themselves as elves from a family, and another that has camped outside the city on a landscaped forest.

After entering the city the group will be searched, revealing that they have weapons and armors but no sign of allegiance to the Usurper Sulyvhan, and will be requested to either not interfere with the fighting or join the assault against the north eastern gate.

From outside the city the group camping can see a rising white fog from behind the mountain. As the minutes pass this fog starts to descend upon the city and will eventually cover it in a thick white cloud.


## Unexpected Guide
As the other group awaits outside the city rests and sees the fog descend into the land, a silver fox that guides the group to a crack in the mountain that leads to a cave. Exploring the cave the group can hear the faint sound of metal hitting metal in an anvil.

As the group explores the cave they can see a chasm 30 feet wide and 60 foot deep that leads to an underground river, the blacksmithing sounds come from the other side of the chasm.


## Assault on the North Eastern Gate
The north eastern gate is a section of wall with a small gate that is under the control of the Fursan Knights a group of noblemen that have betrayed the king and are blocking the advancement of the loyalists.

The gate is protected by 8 **bowmen** and 6 **knights** as well as a **draconic sorcerer**.
