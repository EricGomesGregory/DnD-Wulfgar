## Journey to the Cursed Keep
The adventure begins with a cold opening, two characters sit on opposite sides of a small camp fire, a female knight in full plate and a crossbowmen with a faded red gambeson.

***Hugh.***
is a 5' 2'' tall 18 year old men with short curly brown hair, brown eyes... He dawns a plain red gambeson with a faded black lion on his left breast and a crudely drawn red heart engulfed by yellow flames on its back. He wields a handaxe and a light crossbow.

He is a close friend of Ocelfia, a very loyal and brave men, if a little stupid. He discovered Ocelfia's true capabilities and is worried that she might be following the wrong path.
