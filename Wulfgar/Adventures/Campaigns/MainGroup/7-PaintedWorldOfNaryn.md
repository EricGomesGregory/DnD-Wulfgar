When he was a young man he met a feral woman named Naryn, the forbidden daughter of Innur the traitor dragon, that infatuated both demigods and eventually developed into a secret relationship. At the same time the elves were beginning to discover the deception of Innur and began a witch hunt against all of the descendants of Innur, fearing that his beloved would be caught by the hunt Ardghal painted a world of fantasy for her and embedded a mirrored door locked with a twin silver key.

He gifted his painting to one of his brothers, the king of Irithyll, and left the empire with an entourage to the other side of the plains where he would open a mirror with the other twin silver key to his beloved world's.
