When he was a young man he met a feral woman named Naryn, the forbidden daughter of Innur the traitor dragon, that infatuated both demigods and eventually developed into a secret relationship. At the same time the elves were beginning to discover the deception of Innur and began a witch hunt against all of the descendants of Innur, fearing that his beloved would be caught by the hunt Ardghal painted a world of fantasy for her and embedded a mirrored door locked with a twin silver key.

He gifted his painting to one of his brothers, the king of Irithyll, and left the empire with an entourage to the other side of the plains where he would open a mirror with the other twin silver key to his beloved world's. As he was traversing the plains he was caught by the conquest of the Adernian empire and succumbed to the wounds of battle before reaching his destination.

## Ice-Mirror Cave
After Durindal explained the *unlikely friendship* in the temple of the Caretaker, **Ikaron** requested the aid of the party to seek the the ice-mirror cave in the slope of the mountain and slay the white wyrm that lives inside it.

> ##### The Ice-Mirror Cave
> The cave consists of a maze of organic tunnels carved by fire from the gargantuan glacier that composes this section of the mountain.
>
> The tunnels were carved by the albino red wyrm with its innate fire breathing.

### Entrance
The entrance of the cave is a wide crack covered in snow with a shallow ceiling where medium sized creatures can barely pass without hitting their heads.

Within it the party can find the following clues:
- There are torn limbs and appendages of beasts and humanoids stuck on the snow and the area creates a funnel like structure that leads deeper into the cave.
- *DC 17 Wisdom (Perception).* There's a echoing sound of dripping water coming from deeper in the cave.
- *DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation).* Find (1d4 + 1) pinkish-white scales that indicate a large creature.

### Tunnels
After venturing deeper into the cave the party begins to walk in the slippery surface of a sleek organic tunnel of mirror-like ice. Walking deeper into the tunnel the ground becomes so slippery that is needed a DC 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to travel through it.

```
```

### Labyrinth of Mirrors
After sliding down the tunnels the party reaches a section of cave composed of various columns of transparent or mirrored ice that hold the roof of the cavern, creating a labyrinth of mirrors and windows. Echoing from the depths of the cave the party can hear a small hum of the sleeping dragon.

In order to traverse the labyrinth, each time the parties first in the marching oder must make a DC 15 Intelligence save before making a Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failed save the character takes 2 (1d4) Bludgeoning damage.
