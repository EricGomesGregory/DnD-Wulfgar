### Missing Husband
A rumor has been spreading after the harvest festival that the husband of a weaver abandoned her and took their son. She has been hiding in shame in her house ever since.

If the player characters talk to the weaver she will at first avoid them, but after a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check or a successful roleplay argument, she will inform them that her husband and son were selling her fabrics in the nearby village of Auxios.

She will then offer them 10 gp to find them, a 5'8'' tall, 50 year old man with tanned skin and light brown hair; and a 5'4'' tall, 15 year old boy with tanned skin and dark brown hair.
___
The travel to Auxios takes two days of walking or one day on cart (15 gp). During the travel a random event can happen once per day, roll on the Travel to Auxios table.
