# War Preparations
After returning from Eldunhall the party discovers that Birchtown has been partially fortified and the alchemist's invention has been accepted by the Band of the Griffin but is creating a tense atmosphere within the walls. 

## Late Iron
A iron shipment from a mine in the borderlands with Astora is late, Gwyn fears that the wolves have attacked the shipment and that a spy is within the city, so he asks that the party venture to the mine and discover what happened to the iron.

In reality a crew of inquisitors from the holy path has taken the miners hostage and is torturing them in order to discover exactly where is the radiant dwarf.


### Acquiring the Quest
Gwyn summons the party to his war-room, there he informs them that the war preparations have been progressing well but a iron shipment from a nearby mining village of Elland is late by three days. He is worried that the shipment has been attacked by the wolves and that a spy is within Birchtown.

Gwyn then asks to speak one on one with Alaor, while talking he slides the wizard a paper containing a request, the letter reads:

*"I would like you to incriminate the Coppereyes so that after the conflict I can take the city for myself. Make it look as if the conflict was Valerian's attempt at ascending into nobility by marring Melenia as a way to end the war, turning the city into a vassal state to Wexford.*

*As a reward I can aid you in raising an army to recover your ancestral home."*


### Traveling to Elland
The village of Elland is two days away from the city, roll on the Traveling Encounters table twice based on the day.
