# War Preparations
After returning from Eldunhall the party discovers that Birchtown has been partially fortified and the alchemist's invention has been accepted by the Band of the Griffin but is creating a tense atmosphere within the walls. 

## Late Iron
A iron shipment from a mine in the borderlands with Astora is late, Gwyn fears that the wolves have attacked the shipment and that a spy is within the city, so he asks that the party venture to the mine and discover what happened to the iron.

In reality a crew of inquisitors from the holy path has taken the miners hostage and is torturing them in order to discover exactly where is the radiant dwarf.


### Acquiring the Quest
Gwyn summons the party to his war-room, there he informs them that the war preparations have been progressing well but a iron shipment from a nearby mining village of VILLAGE_NAME is late by three days. He is worried that the shipment has been attacked by the wolves and that a spy is within Birchtown.

Gwyn then asks to speak one on one with Alaor...


### Traveling to VILLAGE_NAME

#### VILLAGE_NAME Village
VILLAGE_NAME once was a small and lively village near a lonely hill that was mined by the inhabitants. Now the village has been taken hostage by a group of fanatic inquisitors of the Holy Path, the center of the village is now an execution ground, the houses have been either partially or completely barricaded, and various tents with symbols of the holy path surround the village.

The party reaches the village during a burning and the screams of men, women, and children can be heard from a distance. Within the village there are 1 **Master Inquisitor**, 2 **astoran knights**, and 2d4 **zealots**.
