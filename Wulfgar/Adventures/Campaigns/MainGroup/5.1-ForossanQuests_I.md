*According to legend, the last holder of the Skirn, a dwarf by the name of Justein Saldrisen, built the city of Stonehall for the king Farnor the 7th but when he was marching his clan towards the capital of Tauber he was attacked by the centaur army of Farnese the 3rd of Brinam.*

*During the battle the hammer was stolen from the lifeless hands of Justein by a group of assassins known as the Silver Moon Knights.*

*After the battle, the surviving families fled back to Kaur's Range or to Stonehall, but the Tallerken family fled to Galloway where they have resided ever since.
