## The Harvest Festival
The campaign begins in the last week of autumn. The player characters find themselves among the townsfolk of Birtchtown, celebrating the annual harvest in a massive festival funded by the Coppereye family.

The town's square has been transformed from a place of commerce, into a vibrant party; a massive banquet is held on three long tables, a wooden platform was built for a group of bards to perform and while people dance in front of them, a series of games of skill are held with the weapons and tools made in the hall's forges, and finally various shops and street stores occupy the region surrounding the party.



### Night of Dancing
The player characters can join the festivities by dancing to the music of the bards. If a player character succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check one of the following events can happen. Once an event has happened it can't occur again.
___
***The red dress gall.***
If a male player character succeeds the check, a mysterious young woman with short blond hair, dark brown eyes, a firm grip, and wearing a red summer dress invites the player character to dance.

She will dance with the player character but will deliberately avoid questions such as her name or where she's from. Once the music is over she will kiss them in the cheek and utter a small "thank you" as she disappears into the crowd.
___
***The purple gentleman.***
If a female player character succeeds the check, a tall man with long black hair, moon white skin, light blue eyes, and wearing a purple tunic adorned with white roses invites the player character to dance.

During the dance he introduces himself as Gwyn of Melfia and flits with the player character. Once the music is over he thanks for the dance and informs that he is requested somewhere else, disappearing into the crowd.
