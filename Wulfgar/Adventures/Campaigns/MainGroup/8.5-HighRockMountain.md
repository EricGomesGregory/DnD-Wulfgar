### Banisher Watchtower

From the top of the tower characters can see the walled city of High Rock, a small town "that is a city only in name" within it there are various brick buildings, spires, and towers. Interestingly the walls of the city seem to guard both the city from the outside as well as the city its self.

Within it the party can find the following characters.

He wears a full set of red plate armor adorned with a brass lion on its chest plate. In combat he wields a greatsword.
___
***Loich.*** is a 5'10'' tall man with lightly tanned skin, long wavy brown hair, a clean shaven slender face and reddish-brown eyes.

He wears a red gambeson with a yellow lion on his left chest and a green cape. In combat he wields a pair of scimitars.

#### Night Problems
Sr. Droz will inform the party that no messages nor scouts have returned from the city of High Rock for the past week and he requests that the party that they discover what is happening in the city.

In exchange the party will be given a room and safe passage trough the mountain to the rest of Astora.

If the party accepts, Loich offers the party a key and the map to the scouts entrance of the city.
