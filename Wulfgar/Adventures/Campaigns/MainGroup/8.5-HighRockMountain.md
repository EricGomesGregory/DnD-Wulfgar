## The Necropolis of Nauros
The Necropolis of Nauros is a complex network of tunnels beneath the city of High Rock that first began as a network of tunnels between the houses of the small city for nightly travel.

But in the last year, after the **divine wine incident**, has transformed into a underground city for the army of reanimated skeletons and virgin-born "knights" that grew to men in three months.

### Divine Wine Incident
During one of the monthly visits of the treasurers from the city of Lucerna a auditor of the BANK_NAME gifted Eleanor Hayes, the head priestess of the Orthodox Church of the Holy Path, a number of wine bottles in commemoration of her 79th anniversary.

After consuming the wine bottles during her birthday diner all members that were inebriated had a delirious fever that was known as the *"communal revelation"*, in which the astral form of Alaor revealed to them a path to recover the position of true royalty.
___
In the following months, four strange events occurred that later were known as the *miracles*. Firstly the last son of the former king, Aubin Alaie Hayes, a paralytic 50 year old since his childhood, began to recover and in six months became a capable man.

Then all women, that partook of the wine, began to become younger day after day with most escaping death's door to the early 40's or even younger.

At the same time some of the men, despite not becoming younger, discovered the ability to reanimate and control the dead and with this powers started the construction of the necropolis.

Finally, in the last three months before the present day, some of the women that rejuvenated traveled to the depths of the tunnels of the necropolis and performed virgin births of albino boys that grew to adulthood in this three months.
___
This resulted in a cult of the divine wine, and in preparation of the holy war, the inhabitants of the city have either left for the necropolis underground or have been imprisoned for not being followers leaving the streets empty.


> ##### DM Notes
> Alaor has used its knowledge of the ancient Holy Path's dogmas and mythology in order to attempt to overthrow the current church in revenge.
