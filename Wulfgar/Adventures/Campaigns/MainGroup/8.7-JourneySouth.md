## Astor's Cursed Mansion
On the side of the south road there's a old dilapidated mansion that only appears only at night.

In reality this mansion is the demiplane of Astor, the aspect of astoran trade, that has been cursed by the presence of the hand cannon that Scry traded with him for a future grift.

***Hand Cannon's Curse.*** The hand cannon that Scry traded with Astor survived the eclipse and when exposed to the astral world in Astor's care corrupted his path through time and space.

Among the effects of this corruption the mansion has been invaded by strange warriors from somewhere else, the fear of firearms is molding the non-euclidean space of the mansion and is summoning the fears into the mansion.

### Atrium
The atrium is a simple rectangular room with dark wooden walls adorned with an old faded map of the continent, banners from various houses (some of which the party can't recognize) and a plain door on one of the walls.

A few moments after the party enters the room they can hear the ghostly voice of Astor echo through 

*"Hello "*
<!-- TODO: Create dialogue abut Astor's current situation -->

Opening any of the door leads to a dark 100 foot long 10 foot wide corridor full of portraits of various nobles with a **arquebusier** on the end.

At the end of the corridor the party can find a plain door, opening conjures one of the following rooms.
