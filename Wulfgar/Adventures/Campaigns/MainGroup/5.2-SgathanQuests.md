## The Cursed Marsh
After reaching the outskirts of Oolacile, the crewmates of the ship inform the party that they can not in any circumstance approach the island, but they know a alternative route trough a marsh on the shore of the Liffey.

As the party is coasting the marsh, the fog becomes thicker. After a few minutes coasting the shore the party can spot a broken raft stuck in a tree. After a few more minutes of coasting the shore the party spots a broken raft stuck in a tree.

The party is now stuck in a magical loop, the party can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, on a success the character can hear the faint crying from within the marsh, on a failure the character spots a ***Specter of Regret*** suffering the attack.

***Helga, Wraith of Resentment.*** is a spectral woman with long half braided blond hair, a slender but stern face, green frustrated eyes, and she wears a ornate but ragged dress.

Helga once was the lady of Oolacile and the mother of Hild. She died when the city was overtaken by the forces of her husband's brother and she was wounded and thrown in the lake. Despite surviving the fall she was too week to survive her wounds, so while grasping the roots of the trees she cursed her attackers and wished that her daughter lived.

As a result she imprinted her frustration and regret upon the shore that her body layed to rest causing a wraith with her memories and appearance to take domain there. The only way to vanquish the wraith is to free her doubt abut her lost child.
