## Elf
Elves are tall and slender humanoids with light skin tones and slightly pointed ears. They are commonly found in the Boreal Forest region but some reside in other regions, such as the human dominated Kings Plains.

Elves are deeply religious believing in powerful beasts that were created by the twin progenitor elves.


### Elvish Ethnicities
Elves are mostly homogeneous as a race but they are divided into two ethnicities, the Elyrians and Slivarians.


#### Elyrians
Elyrians are slightly tanned elves, with pale blond to golden brown hair, and with brown eyes. Elyrians are famous for being brash and loud with little to no political cohesion between the many cities of the valley, but with a strong brotherhood when it comes to dealing with outsiders.

They are commonly found in the Goldpine Valley of the Boreal Forest.


#### Silvarians
Silvarians are paler skinned elves, with dark-brown or black hair, and grey eyes. Silvarians are famous for being reclusive and silver tongued with a strong sense of nationality.

They are commonly found in the Sgaathan Basin of the Boreal Forest.

### Height and Weight
You can generate the height and weight of your character using the Random Weight and Height table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character's extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. The same number multiplied by the dice roll of the Weight Modifier column determines the character's extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.
