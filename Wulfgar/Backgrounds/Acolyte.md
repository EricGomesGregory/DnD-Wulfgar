As an acolyte, you Command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your Adventuring companions can expect to receive free care at a Temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith. Those who share your Religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific Temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a Residence there.
