> # Death of Wolves, Rise of Griffins

___
This is the story of how Gwyn went from a soldier in the Band of the Wolves to the commander of the Band of the Griffins.

### The Wolves
The Wolves were a band of mercenaries in the kingdom of Hafexia that were famous for their ferocity in battle.

During its apex the mercenary group was commanded by a man named Heindel, the Fang. That was famous for being a seasoned veteran and a roughtless man in and out of battle.

#### Heindel, the Fang
Heindel was a 5'8 hafexian man with short black hair, warm white skin, brown eyes and a fang shaped scar on his upper lip. He dawned a worn set of plate armor, a black tabard emblazoned with a white wolf and a claymore.

#### Structure
The mercenary group was formed of 4 divisions, each containing 10 squadrons of 5 men each. The 1st squadron was the only exception, as it was the main force, containing 20 squadrons. The 2nd division was the rear guard, tasked with defending the Heindel and the camp. Whilst the 3rd and 4th divisions were tasked with flanking the enemy.

In addition the mercenary group had an auxiliary division formed of tradesman and servants that worked to maintain the soldiers equipment, catalog and distribute rations and carry additional equipment.

### Turbulent Family
To Heindel blood relations were of little value, he believed that all the members of his mercenary company were his sons. But he held Heyso, his biological son, in a special place as he new he would be his legacy, so Heindel made him a squadron commander of the 1st division so the young boy would learn to command.

But as the years passed Heindel grew fearfull for his life as he new that some of his sons might want to usurp the Band of the Wolves for themselves and as a result he needed a trustworthy son at his side to protect him. So he gave the command of the 2nd division to his son Heyso at his 18th birthday.

Heyso was an arrogant man from an early age, seeing himself as the son of the Fangs and the unquestionable heir of the Wolves. He wished to become the 1st division commander, bringing glory to his father by destroying his enemies. So the news that he would become the commander of the rearguard was seen as an insult to him.

## Member of the Pack
When Gwyn was a 16 year old lad he thought himself a natural duelist, having wined all duels with his friends in the streets of Melfia during his entire childhood.

So when he heard that a mercenary band was in town and was searching for new recrutes he jumped in the opportunity. Rushing to the camp at the outskirts of Melfia before noon.

At the Band of the Wolves camp Gwyn challenged Heindel to a duel to prove himself. The fight was quick and decisive with Gwyn in the ground as soon as he had brandished his weapon.

Even though Gwyn had lost his duel, Heindel was intrigued by the lad's courage and as a result decided to take Gwyn as one of the Wolves.

___
During his early days as a wolf Gwyn was given the worst tasks, having to clean the stables, carry heavy equipment during the band's marches, as well as many other demoralizing tasks.

Progressively Gwyn was given better tasks such as helping the soldiers to dawn their armors, guard the camp and forage for food with his wolf Nymeria.

One night when he was guarding the camp in the outskirts of Nuremberg, Gwyn spotted a shadowy figure dash into one of the tents. Without a second thought he perused the invader into the dark tent shouting for him to stop.

When the figure froze in front of him he thought he had seen a weapon in the small figure's hand and with his blood boiling and a thumping in his ears, he trusted his sword into the figure. When the others came to see what was happening Gwyn discovered that he had killed a eight year old child that was carrying a knife.
___
That memory has haunted Gwyn ever since.


## Gwyn's Rise
As the years passed Gwyn slowly became a valuable soldier to the Band of the Wolves, having risen from the post of scout to soldier and eventually to the position of squadron commander.

During this time Gwyn fought many battles as part of the 1st division of the Band of the Wolves, taking part of many sieges, rading enemy camps at the dead of night and even killing a rogue knight during a manhunt.

As his accomplishments grew Gwyn became the target of envy of Heindel's son, Heyso that at the time was the commander of the 2nd division. This only worsened when Gwyn was declared the 1st division commander in his 18th birthday, to the surprise of Heyso.

## The Dammed Siege
One month after Gwyn's promotion to the position of 1st division commander, the Band of the Wolves were tasked with besieging a keep at the border between Hafexia and Forrosa.

The siege started out as any other, the band entrenched themselves around the castle and began to raid the supply caravans and villages nearby. But as the months went on the armies morale began to decrease.

Infighting began as the men were sick of being stuck with nothing to do and were worried that the coming winter would wipe them out. Gwyn then rose to the occasion maintaining the mercenaries morale in his division.

___
One day Heindel, that was acting strangely since the beginning of the siege, ordered a full assault at the keep. The 1st and 2nd were to merge into one force and perform a ladder rush while the 3rd and 4th divisions were to flank the keep.

At the crack of dawn the forces moved into position, Gwyn at the left side of Heindel with his forces and Heyso at the right side of Heindel with his forces.

The battle was brutal, the rush was half successful as the enemies archers were the sharpest they ever seen.

Gwyn and his men were able to reach the walls and invade the outer keep but the battle inside the walls was brutal, with heavy casualties on both sides. When all of a sudden the keeps gate were thrown open, Gwyn and his men invaded and quickly killed the remaining retainers reaching the nobleman's quarters.
___
There they found, within the luxurious room, a servant holding a knife and covered in blood as well as the body of the lord of the keep. That 19 year old woman, named Aileen, later would join Gwyn in his new band. As the battle died down and the enemy forces surrendered Gwyn discovered that Heindel died in the ladder rush and half of the band died in the conflict.

To worsen the situation the low morale of the Wolves caused the 3rd and 4th divisions to abandoned the battle as soon as Heindel had died. Heyso was attempting to maintain the remaining warriors united but due to its arrogant nature the Band of the Wolves quckly disbanded in the days after the funeral of Heindel.

## Rise of the Griffins
Gwyn, after seeing the state of the Wolves decided this was the time to change his fate and become more then he was. So in the dead of night he organized with members of his squadrons of the 1st division, Aileen and even the traitor of the siege Ludwig to form a new band of mercenaries.

So in the crack of dawn Gwyn, Aileen, Ludwig and 12 other members of the 1st and 2nd divisions of the wolves quietly marched away from the Wolves camp with a handful of tradesman and a few carts of equipment and loot from the siege.

From that day on they called themselves the Band of the Griffin.
