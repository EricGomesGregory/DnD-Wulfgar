# Eras of Wulfgar
___
The history of Wulfgar is split into three eras...

## Age of Myth
In the beginning monsters roamed the land, dragons ruled the sky, giants dominated the mountains, and fiends lurked in the caves. But that all started to change when the humanoids started to rise.

### Elf History
The elves, native of the Boreal Forest, during the Age of Myth were ruled by dragons that herald from the north.

### Dwarf History
During the Age of Myth the dwarves emerged from the mud of the mountains, at first there were very few dwarves but as they started to explore the mountain range their numbers quickly grew. This angered the fiends that lived in the caves and war broke out between the dwarves and the fiendish creatures.

At first the dwarves were weak and ineffective, as the fiends lived in the caves before them, but when Kaur, the first Iron Lord, thought the dwarves how to make weapons from the iron of the mountains the tide of the war changed to their favor. In the end the fiends were banished to the boiling sea where they remain to this day.

After the war Kaur had N children, that he ordered to shepherd the dwarves from then on, and as a last act he climbed the tallest mountain the range dying at the summit and from his body the fortress of Kragmeer grew.

### Human History
Humans emerged from the clay of the Nhar river at the end of the Age of Myth, being free from any race more powerful to rule them, humans quickly grew in number and established many villages along the Nhar.

This caught the attention of the monsters that lurked in the hills. The weak humans, devoid of any divinity, suffered from the many attacks of the many monsters that lurked the lands beyond the Nhar banks.

To protect themselves the humans created an order of monster hunters known as MONSTER_HUNTER_FACTION. They were responsible for studying the monsters and killing them. 

### Goliath History
During the Age of Myth the goliaths emerged from the mountains of Vrostia as the last and lesser giants, where their brothers and sisters could hurl lightning from their hands, blow howling winds, or lift small castles; the goliaths only were numerous. As a result they were quickly enslaved as punishment for their weakness.

As the age progressed the goliaths became resentful of their brothers and sisters and started to desire freedom. So when a slave named Vrostus rose up against his master and like a spark to alchemist fire his rebellion grew into a war that spilled the blood of hundreds of thousands of giants and goliaths.

At the end of the war all giants were murdered, their blood cursing the land so that very little food could grow. Vrostus for all his bravery died on the battlefield without any heirs. So the remaining goliaths formed clans and fought one another for the few resources that the land had.
