## Dwarvish History
<!-- Race Origin -->
The dwarves were born from the stone of the caves of their mountain range, during the begging of the Age of Myth. At first they were few, but as they explored the mountains their numbers quickly grew.

This enraged the previous inhabitants of the mountain range the fiendish goatman, that attacked the dwarves in their caves that escalated into war.

At first the dwarves were weak and ineffective against the goatman, as their hide was as strong as leather and their bronze swords cut through dwarven skin with ease, this forced the dwarves to retreat deep into the caves. 

While the remaining dwarves licked their wounds and waited for their inevitable demise at the hands of the fiends. A dwarf named Kaur discovered the art of forging iron, with this knowledge he raised an army of black dwarves to meat the goatman on the battlefield.

The weapons made by Kaur sliced through the goatman's hide effortlessly and the black armor that covered Kaur's dwarves was impenetrable to the bronze blades of the fiends.

As Kaur's army began to win against the goatman, more dwarves joined him on the battlefield...
