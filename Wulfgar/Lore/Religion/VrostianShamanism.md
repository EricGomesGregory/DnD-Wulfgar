## Vrostian Shamanism
In the beginning of the world, when the land was covered in ash, the great spirit of the sky Bozhe used his essence to create the giants.

Bozhe first placed his essence in a basin, it then plucked the storms from the sky and passed them through the basin creating the Burya, then Bozhe caught the wind and fed it its essence creating the Veter, then it grabbed the flames that doweled in the ground and placed it in its basin creating the Pozhar. As the essence in the bowl began to dwindle Bozhe used it to water the mountains and hills creating the Hora and the Pahorb, and finally with the remaining essence Bozhe hurled it into the air raining its essence into the ground creating the Goliaths.

After performing its creation Bozhe decided to slumber so it could recover its essence, leaving its creation to its own devices believing it to be as good as Bozhe its self.

As the great spirit of the sky slumbered, an evil that resided beneath the ash infected the mind of the giants. At first it sowing distrust between them, then it taught them elemental powers so they could protect themselves from each other, then the dark voice gave them the ideas of slavery and domination, and finally the voice taught them the idea of an empire.

As the voice rested laughed at the chaos, it forgot to infect the goliaths that were so numerous but so weak, but the other giants used the naive goliaths as slaves on the battlefield teaching them the curse of resentment.

When Bozhe awakened from its slumber it found its creation cursed with various evils, frustrated it came to the few goliaths that were only cursed with resentment and offered a covenant: *"My children your brothers and sisters have been lead astray by a dark creature so I offer you my guidance and a eternal place on my domain, but you must slay your cursed kin in return."*

From that day on those who took up the covenant began to slay the giants in the name of Bozhe until the only that remained were the goliaths. But the voice was clever and for every giant slain, the killers were slightly infected by the curses that afflicted the giant. Until no goliath was capable of fully joining Bozhe in its promised land.
