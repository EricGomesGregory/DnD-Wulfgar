## Elemental Kings
At first there was only the formless void Qmn, then four great elementals emerged from the void. First came Sakhr, the Sun Lord that saw a world without distinction and sacrificed his heart to create the sun, light and shadow.

Then came Nuhm, the Pygmy Lord that witnessed space with distinction but no vastness nor form, therefore he tore away his face so that the sun could shine on land. Then came Ashar, the Sylph Queen offered her body so that the land could be touched by wind and change could occur on this vast land of dawn and dusk.

Finally came Qayana, the Nymph Mother; she saw a vast barren land that changed to the rhythm of the wind thus she decided to bleed her royal blood in order to bless the land with water and life. So the world would not be only the land but also the creatures and peoples that inhabit it.

After creating their shared realm the elemental kings began to work creating their court,

Finally the four lords of the world decided to create those who would inherit their kingdom. So Nuhm created a pair of relatively small bodies with two arms, two legs, and a head each. When he finished the shell Sakhr ignited the bodies giving them power and passion, then Ashar blew on them gifting cunning and desire to their souls and finally Qayana gave the shells her waters of royal life to drink. Bringing man and woman into the world as their last act of creation.
