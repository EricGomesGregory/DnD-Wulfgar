## Old Gods
In the begging there was a twin branched tree in the Boreal Forrest that gave fruit to two elves: Elyrion, a golden haired man with a muscled body, brash personality and a affinity with animals; and Silvaris a black haired woman with marble skin, a inquisitive personality and endless desire for knowledge.

Together they fathered the elven race and began to build a civilization in peace. But then the dragons came from beyond the ash sea and in a single swift battle decimated the elves and enslaved them.

Elyrion was separated from Silvaria and their children were forced to attend all the dragons wishes. As the years gone by Eyrion began to fight the dragons in a guerrilla war with the aid of his sons and daughters. While Silvaria worked in the dead of night studding ways to break the dragons impenetrable scales.

As Elyrion's war grew in his favor, Silvaria discovered a way to brake the dragons scales and in the dead of night while all slept Silvaria sacrificed herself to create the moon and came to Elyrion in his dreams to inform him of her sacrifice and to say her goodbye.

After hearing her message Elyrion was furious, he awoke his best soldiers and they attacked the dragons with a wrathful fury. When dawn came most of the dragons were dead and those who remained fled back beyond the ash sea.

The elves were finally free from draconic rule, but Elyrion was still furious. He slowly left his sons and daughters to their own devices in a journey to find his beloved, but as the years passed he found no way to bring her back.

When Elyrion returned he was furious to find that the elves began to fight among themselves. He was exhausted from his journey, so Elyrion decided to raised seven beasts to protect and guide the elven race.

With his heart full of sorrow and his elves protected by his beasts, he hurled himself into the sun where he resides.
