# Holy Path
___
The Holy Path is a monotheistic religion practiced by the majority of
humans, especially Adernians, Astorans and some Hafexians and even Forossans.

Modern practitioners of the religion seek to atone for the sins of the ancestral humans by following a path to salvation by living their entire lives devoted to one aspect of God. Thus most followers of the religion devote themselves to a craft associated with an aspect.

## History
The Holy Path originated when the Adernian Empire was in its brutal state in which it grew by the power of the sword and the vision of the immortal emperor Adernus.

During this time the wife of a chieftain of a unknown village, located in the path of the Adernian conquest, awaited with dread and anxiety news of the battlefield.

As she waited for seven suns her heart and stomach were unable to bare and at the dawn of the 7th day she locked herself in a cave. Where she had a miscarriage and a revelation.

When she returned to her village, bloodied and determined she ordered a messenger to send a message to the battlefield and commanded the inhabitants to follow her into the savanna.

For a decade she lead her people through the hostile land to a secluded oasis. During this period she had more and more visions of both the horrors of the Adernian conquest as well as the future that this path will lead.

When she reached the oasis she was the first to bathe, from sunrise to sunset, to prove to her people that the oasis wasn't an illusion.

While she bathed in the water, God revealed to her a narrow path for the salvation of humanity from the path of conquest and violence that Adernus unleashed into the world.
___
Nine months after bathing in the oasis she performed a virgin birth of an heir, despite not having taken up a new husband or concubine.

This heir eventually grew to be a disciple of God and when the time came he left the village in the oasis in order to spread the Holy Path.

### Rise of the Messiah
When the heir reached the now consolidated Adernian Empire he found a large number of people living in misery under the thumb of the ravenous emperor.

As he entered the unknown world, armed with his mother's teachings and visions like hers, he had a series of misadventures that taught him the brutality of this world.

But as he stumbled through the streets of the cities along the Nhar he befriended a crestfallen knight that had lost his sword, a mute and deaf scholar that was abandoned by all his students and a whore that adopted two children.

With this friends he begun to help not only his three friends but also the various peoples of the Nhar and taught them the Holy Path to God. As his influence grew the hatred from the empire grew to match.

### Ancient Times to Present
As the Adernian Empire fell after the battle of the lonely hill, the Holy Path now under the command of the disciples of the nameless messiah slowly grew in power and influence on the courts of the heirs of the last blood relatives of the ancient emperor Adernus.

- The seat of power of the church of the Holy Path is located within Lion in Astora.

#### The Divine Rupture
As the nobility of Astora isolated its beliefs in the old texts of the, now known as the orthodox beliefs, the Holy Path grew and diversified in the fields of Astora and Adernia to a point to almost being unrecognizable and incompatible between the two.

This culminated in the **Divine Rupture** where the members of the orthodox church were massacred by the armies of the rebelling lesser nobility and clergy.

- This event caused the formation of the Inquisition.

The last remaining followers of the Orthodox Holy Path Church live in High Rock and a few of the surrounding villages and towns.
