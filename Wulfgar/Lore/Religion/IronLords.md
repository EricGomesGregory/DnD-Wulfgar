## Iron Lords
In the ancient times the dwarves were a race relegated to the depths of the caverns of the world as the surface was dominated by the fiendish goat-mans that enslaved and subjugated all they could find.
___
Among the dwarves that survived in the dark Kaur, a tall muscular dwarf with crimson hair, was exploring a deep hollow when the ground gave way and he fell for what felt like an eternity.

Kaur was knocked unconscious by the fall, during which time he had a vision of a dwarf made of black-iron that bargained with him, if he could kill a creature that d welled in the depths the god would grant him its black-blood. Kaur then fashioned a spear out of a staff and a stone shard and slew the beast of the deep. In the creature's lair Kaur found lumps of black-iron like the god's body.
___
After returning from his adventure Kaur had changed, he had become more muscular, taller, and his eyes were attuned to the darkest of tunnels.

In the nights after his return he had visions of a great and bloody battle against the goat-man so in the days after his premonition Kaur enlisted the help of his friend Saldrin, that was a grate artisan, to craft weapons out of the black-iron.
___
When Kaur's army was ready he led them into the surface, where they proceed to destroy the goat-man as their bronze weapons were no match to the black-iron.
