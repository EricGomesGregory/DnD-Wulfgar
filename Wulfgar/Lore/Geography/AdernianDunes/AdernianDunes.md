# Adernian Dunes
___
The Adernian Dunes, located in the southwestern region of the continent, is known for its extensive desert, buried ruins of the ancient Adernian Empire, and decadent cities that reside along the few fertile lands in the banks of the Nhar river.

The region is mostly inhabited by humans, usually of a darker skin tone, that reside on the city states of thr Nhar Banks.

Beyond the river there is a harsh desert that stretches beyond the eye can see.
