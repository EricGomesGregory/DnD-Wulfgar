#### Brawling Master
You've mastered your unarmed attacks to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. You gain the following benefits:

- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a unarmed strike or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one unarmed strike attack as a bonus action.

- Before you make a unarmed strike that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
